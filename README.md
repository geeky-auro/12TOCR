12T OCR is an Android app that allows users to scan and digitize any text document, such as receipts, invoices, notes, etc. The app uses the following technologies:
Programming Language Used: Kotlin, XML
Tools and TEchnologies used: Firebase ML-Kit, CameraX Library

The app uses the CameraX Library to access the device’s camera and capture images of text documents. It then uses the Firebase ML-Kit’s OCR feature to extract the text from the images and convert it into a digital format. The app also uses XML to define the user interface and layout of the app. The app is written in Kotlin, which offers many advantages such as null safety, coroutines, extension functions, data classes, etc.

The app’s main goal is to make it easy and convenient for users to scan and digitize any text document, and to edit, search, and store them electronically. The app also supports multiple languages and formats, and can export the scanned documents as PDF or TXT files. The app is designed to be user-friendly, fast, and accurate.
